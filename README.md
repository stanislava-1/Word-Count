# Word-Count
A project assigned by myself to test my ability to code in Python and use Jinja2 after finishing the Udacity online course Intro to Programming. It is a web application that takes a text and produces an analysis of the text: occurrence of different words (number and percentage), total number of words, number of different words and number of words that create 80% of the text.

Used technologies:
HTML, CSS, Python, Jinja2, Google App Engine
